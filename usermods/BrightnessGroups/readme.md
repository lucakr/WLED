# Welcome to the brightness groups usermod!

Enables allocation of each pixel to a specific brightness scaling level using up to 4 groups.

I wrote this primarily for use on strips wrapped around an apartment railing, where I wanted to maximum the brightness from the LEDs facing the balcony without making my railing look like the sun from the street. It's tedious to setup but useful once in place.

## Installation

define `USERMOD_BRIGHTNESS_GROUPS` in `wled00/my_config.h`
